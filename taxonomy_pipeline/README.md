With funding from the UC Santa Barbara Coastal Fund, we have been implementing and comparing various taxonomic assignment algorithms and reference databases. We are in the process of creating an "ensemble" taxonomic assignment algorithm incorporating information from the various assignment algorithms and databases to improve the resolution and accuracy of taxonomic assignments. 

This directory will contain the relevant code and data used in these efforts.
