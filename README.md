# amplicon_bioinformatics

This repository includes data and code with applications to amplicon sequencing assessments of marine protist communities. My work so far has relied exclusively on the V9 hypervariable region of the 18S rRNA gene, but a lot of the code included here is likely generalizable to other genes and hypervariable regions. 

All code and data provided in this repository are freely available for use by anyone for any and all applications. Please be cool about it - cite an appropriate paper of mine or the people I'm ripping off, etc.

I am not legally responsible for any use or misuse of anything found in this repository, nor do I guarantee accuracy of any files in this repository. That said, please notify me if you find errors and/or inaccuracies :)
